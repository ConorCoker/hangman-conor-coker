# Hangman Game in Kotlin

This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Hangman game, created using Kotlin programming language. The game was created as part of Assignment 3 in the Software Development Tools module.

## How to Play

To play the game, simply run the `main()` function in the `Main.kt` file. The game will prompt you to enter a difficulty level (1 to 5), after which it will generate a random word for you to guess. You will have a limited number of guesses to uncover the word, with each incorrect guess causing the hangman to be closer to his demise!

Once you have guessed the word or the hangman has been hung, the game will end and display the answer.

## Features

- Difficulty levels ranging from easy to hard
